## Term Projects
I put my class projects here

* [Optics project](Optics/)
* [Neutron beta decay](Neutrinos/)
* [Variational method in electrodynamics](Variational/)


## My Undergrad Project
In the [discs](\discs) folder, you can find some of the codes I wrote for my undergrade project. It's mostley optimizing data and plotting lightcurves of microlensing events. Here's a link to the paper we (My professor and I) published: [arxiv:2008.02847](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02847)


## CV
And here you can find my CV: [My CV](CV/Ali_Salehi_CV.pdf)


## Manim clips
I made a few short [manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) clips about special relativity, microlensing and geometrical congruence. you can find them in [Manim clips](Manim_clips) folder.
