# My Undergrad Project
In the [discs](\discs) folder, you can find some of the codes I wrote for my undergrade project. It's mostley optimizing data and plotting lightcurves of microlensing events. here's the link to the paper we (My professor and I) published: [arxiv:2008.02847](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02847)


And here you can find my CV: [My CV](CV/Ali_Salehi_CV.pdf)
