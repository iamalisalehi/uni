   abstract = {We present the relativistic calculation of the β-decay of tritium in a hadron model. The elementary particle treatment (EPT) of the transition H3 →He3 +e-+ν̄e is performed in analogy with the description of the β-decay of neutron. The effects of higher order terms of hadron current and nuclear recoil are taken into account in this formalism. The relativistic Kurie function is derived and presented in a simple form suitable for the determination of neutrino masses from the shape of the endpoint spectrum. A connection with the commonly used Kurie function is established. © 2008 The American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {The objective of the Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino (KATRIN) experiment is to determine the effective electron neutrino mass m(ν e ) with an unprecedented sensitivity of 0.2 eV / c 2 (90%C.L.) by precision electron spectroscopy close to the endpoint of the β -decay of tritium. We present a consistent theoretical description of the β -electron energy spectrum in the endpoint region, an accurate model of the apparatus response function, and the statistical approaches suited to interpret and analyze tritium β -decay data observed with KATRIN with the envisaged precision. In addition to providing detailed analytical expressions for all formulae used in the presented model framework with the necessary detail of derivation, we discuss and quantify the impact of theoretical and experimental corrections on the measured m(ν e ). Finally, we outline the statistical methods for parameter inference and the construction of confidence intervals that are appropriate for a neutrino mass measurement with KATRIN. In this context, we briefly discuss the choice of the β -energy analysis interval and the distribution of measuring time within that range.},

   abstract = {The determination of the neutrino mass is one of the major challenges in astroparticle physics today. Direct neutrino mass experiments, based solely on the kinematics of beta-decay, provide a largely model-independent probe to the neutrino mass scale. The Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino (KATRIN) experiment is designed to directly measure the effective electron antineutrino mass with a sensitivity of 0.2 eV 90% CL. In this work we report on the first operation of KATRIN with tritium which took place in 2018. During this commissioning phase of the tritium circulation system, excellent agreement of the theoretical prediction with the recorded spectra was found and stable conditions over a time period of 13 days could be established. These results are an essential prerequisite for the subsequent neutrino mass measurements with KATRIN in 2019.},

   abstract = {A discovery that neutrinos are Majorana fermions would have profound implications for particle physics and cosmology. The Majorana character of neutrinos would make possible the neutrinoless double-β (Oνββ) decay, a matter-creating process without the balancing emission of antimatter. The GERDA Collaboration searches for the Oνββ decay of 76Ge by operating bare germanium detectors in an active liquid argon shield. With a total exposure of 82.4 kg·year, we observe no signal and derive a lower half-life limit of T1/2 > 0.9 × 1026 years (90% C.L.). Our T1/2 sensitivity, assuming no signal, is 1.1 × 1026 years. Combining the latter with those from other Oνββ decay searches yields a sensitivity to the effective Majorana neutrino mass of 0.07 to 0.16 electron volts.},

   abstract = {The β decay of molecular tritium currently provides the highest sensitivity in laboratory-based neutrino mass measurements. The upcoming Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino (KATRIN) experiment will improve the sensitivity to 0.2 eV, making a percent-level quantitative understanding of molecular effects essential. The modern theoretical calculations available for neutrino mass experiments agree with spectroscopic data. Moreover, when neutrino mass experiments performed in the 1980s with gaseous tritium are reevaluated using these modern calculations, the extracted neutrino mass squared values are consistent with zero instead of being significantly negative. However, the calculated molecular final-state branching ratios are in conflict with dissociation experiments performed in the 1950s. We reexamine the theory of the final-state spectrum of molecular-tritium decay and its effect on the determination of the neutrino mass, with an emphasis on the role of the vibrational- and rotational-state distribution in the ground electronic state. General features can be reproduced quantitatively from considerations of kinematics and zero-point motion. We summarize the status of validation efforts and suggest means for resolving the apparent discrepancy in dissociation rates.},
