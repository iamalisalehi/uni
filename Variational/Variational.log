I was expecting to see something like `(' or `\{' or
`\}' here. If you typed, e.g., `{' instead of `\{', you
should probably delete the `{' by typing `1' now, so that
braces don't get unbalanced. Otherwise just proceed.
Acceptable delimiters are characters whose \delcode is
nonnegative, or you can use `\delimiter <delimiter code>'.

! Extra }, or forgotten \right.

l.627         \end{align*}
                          
I've deleted a group-closing symbol because it seems to be
spurious, as in `$x}$'. But perhaps the } is legitimate and
you forgot something else, as in `\hbox{$x}'. In such cases
the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the
deleted material, e.g., by typing `I$}'.

! Missing \right. inserted.
<inserted text> 
                \right .
l.627         \end{align*}
                          
I've inserted something that you may have forgotten.
(See the <inserted text> above.)
With luck, this will get me unwedged. But if you
really didn't forget anything, try typing `2' now; then
my insertion and my current dilemma will both disappear.

! Missing } inserted.
<inserted text> 
                }

I've inserted something that you may have forgotten.
(See the <inserted text> above.)
With luck, this will get me unwedged. But if you
really didn't forget anything, try typing `2' now; then
my insertion and my current dilemma will both disappear.

                   \let 
l.994     \end{align*}
                      
I was expecting to see something like `(' or `\{' or
`\}' here. If you typed, e.g., `{' instead of `\{', you
should probably delete the `{' by typing `1' now, so that
braces don't get unbalanced. Otherwise just proceed.
Acceptable delimiters are characters whose \delcode is
nonnegative, or you can use `\delimiter <delimiter code>'.

! Extra \right.
<to be read again> 
                   \let 
l.994     \end{align*}
                      
I'm ignoring a \right that had no matching \left.

! Missing \endgroup inserted.

! Misplaced \omit.
\math@cr@@@ ...@ \@ne \add@amps \maxfields@ \omit 
                                                  \kern -\alignsep@ \iftag@ ...
l.994     \end{align*}
                      
I expect to see \omit only after tab marks or the \cr of
an alignment. Proceed, and I'll ignore this case.

! Missing { inserted.
<inserted text> 
                {
l.994     \end{align*}
                      
I've put in what seems to be necessary to fix
the current column of the current alignment.
Try to go on, since this might almost work.
